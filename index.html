    <h1 class="title">Bob Marley</h1>
    <h3 class="el">Early Life and Career</h3>
    <p class="first">Bob Marley was born 6 February 1945 on the farm of his maternal grandfather in Nine Mile, Saint Ann
        Parish,
        Jamaica, to Norval Sinclair Marley (1885-1955) and Cedella Booker (1926-2008).[12] Norval Marely was a white
        Jamaican originally from Sussex, England, whose famaily claimed Syrian Jewish origins.[13][14][15] Norval
        claimed to have been a captian in the Royal Marines;[16] at the time of his marraige to Cedella Booker, and
        Afro-Jamaican then 18 years old, he was employed as a plantation overseer.[16][17]</p>
    <h3 class="mc">Musical Career</h3>
    <p class="second">In February 1962, Marley recorded four songs, "Judge Not", "One Cup of Coffee", "Do You Still Love
        Me?" and
        "Terror", at Federal Studios for local music producer Leslie Kong.[31] Three of the songs were released on
        Beverley's with "One Cup of Coffee" being released under the pseudonym Bobby Martell.[32]</p>
    <h3 class="id">Illness and Death</h3>
    <p class="third">In July 1977, Marley was diagnosed with a type of malignant melanoma under his right great toe.
        Contrary to urban legend, this lesion was not primarily caused by an injury during a football match that year,
        but was instead a symptom of already-existing cancer. Marley turned down his doctors' advice to have his toe
        amputated (which would have hindederd his performing career), citing his religious beliefs, and instead, the
        nail and nail bed were removed and a skin graft was taken from his thigh to cover the area.</p>
